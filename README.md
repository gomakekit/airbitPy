This is a micropython code for Airbit, <a href="https://www.airbit.no">www.airbit.no</a><br>
Use one code for the transmitter and one for the receiver. Control works similar to the original air:bit, https://www.makekit.no/airbit-docs <br>
See distributors:  <a href="https://www.makekit.no/findreseller">airbit</a><br>
Thanks to Svein Tore Narvestad for a huge contribution via https://github.com/Svein-Tore/Airpy <br>
This is a beta version. Feel free to contribute!<br>

<b>Important! There is currently no low battery auto landing. Emptying lipo batteries can make them unusable. When the thrust start to fade, land and charge immediately. Do not attempt to fly with the throttle on 100%. </b>
